# 67328FinalProject
Final project of 67328. This project involves using 3rd party apis, authorization, nodes, Ajax, etc.

##Summary

My project allows people to look up for available adoptable dogs. It allows users to specify features of a dog they are looking for, and after the search, it will provide minimum information about the available pet: name, contact info, age, sex, size, breed etc. Not only this, it also allows user to interact and participate in a game where users are given a dog image and to collect a point, they need to get the right breed name that correspond with the image.

##API Useed
